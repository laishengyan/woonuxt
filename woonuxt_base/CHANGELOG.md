## 3.4.27 (06-04-2024)

### Bug Fixes

- The default variation is now respected. Also, if there are no defaults set, the first of each attribute is selected. IMO I think that is better than having the user select the first option for each attribute. [#141](https://github.com/scottyzen/woonuxt/issues/141)
